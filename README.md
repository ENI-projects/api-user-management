# Welcome to api-user-management üëã

> API to manage our users from the apps in keycloak

## üè† [Homepage](https://gitlab.com/startfleet/api-user-management#readme)

The API is made in nodejs using hapi.

## Launching the API in local
> nodejs is required

```
export NODE_ENV=development
node server.js or npm start
```
This will launch a nodejs web server using the .env.development environment variable file and exposing the port 3000 of your computer.

## Endpoints

There are 5 endpoints that are used to manage the users between the database of the apps and keycloak :

### Getting the list of the users in the company
```
GET /users
```
__Rights :__ This endpoint is only available to connected users having the "adminentreprise" role into the armadacar app and will only retrive users that are in the company of the caller.

### Getting the infos about 1 user
```
GET /user/{id}
```
__Rights :__ This endpoint is only available to connected users having the "adminentreprise" role into the armadacar app and will only retrive users that are in the company of the caller, otherwise a HTTP 404 is returned.
